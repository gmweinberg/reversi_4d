		<title>Reversi 4D help</title>
</head>
<body>
		<p>Reversi is a game invented in the 1800s, you have these coins tat are black on one side
		   and whit on the other. It's better known by the same name as the Shakespear play with the Moor,
		   but I cannot call it by that name since it is trademarked.</p>
		<p>Reversi in 4 dimensions works much like the 2d version except there are many more directions
		(4 linear dimensions, plus diagonals os 2, 3, and 4 dimensions in combination).
		The 4 dimesnions are rpresented on a 2d screen as grid of planar slices.
		We support PVP
		(on the same computer, take turns), PVC, or if you're realy bored you can watch the computer play vs itself.
		There is currently no netwrok support. You can play with a side length of 4, 6, or 8.
